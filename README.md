## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No build tools or dependencies required!

### Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/howjerry/sumire.github.io.git
   cd sumire.github.io
   ```

2. **Open any HTML file in your browser**:
   ```bash
   # macOS
   open karpathy_study_tips_scroll_website.html

   # Linux
   xdg-open karpathy_study_tips_scroll_website.html

   # Windows
   start karpathy_study_tips_scroll_website.html
   ```

3. **Or serve with a local server** (optional):
   ```bash
   # Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000

   # Node.js (with http-server)
   npx http-server
   ```

## üé® Design Philosophy

### Minimalism First

- Pure black (#000000) and white (#FFFFFF) color palette
- Maximum whitespace for breathing room
- Typography as the primary visual element
- Content over decoration

### Performance Optimized

- Single-file architecture (no external dependencies except CDN libraries)
- GPU-accelerated animations using `transform` and `opacity`
- Responsive media queries with simplified mobile animations
- Lazy loading of animation effects

### Accessibility Considerations

- Semantic HTML5 structure
- Proper heading hierarchy
- High contrast ratios (21:1 for black on white)
- Keyboard navigation support
- Reduced motion support (can be enhanced further)

## üìù Development Notes

### Animation Architecture

All animations use GSAP's ScrollTrigger with the following patterns:

- **Pin Effects**: Large section numbers stay fixed during scroll
- **Stagger Animations**: Sequential reveals with 0.15s delays
- **Responsive Animations**: Desktop gets full effects, mobile gets simplified versions
- **Easing Functions**: Carefully chosen for weight and naturalness
  - `power4.out` for headings (heavier feel)
  - `power3.out` for content (lighter feel)
  - `power2.inOut` for transitions

### Browser Compatibility

- **Modern Browsers**: Full support for Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- **Mobile Browsers**: iOS Safari 14+, Chrome Mobile 90+
- **Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation for older browsers (no animations, but content remains accessible)
